# WQD7001_Credit_Card_Fraud_Prediction
## Introduction 
Credit card usage has become more common and popular in modern financial transactions, it offers conveniences and flexibility to consumer worldwide. Payment with cards and even mobile devices has become the new habit of consumers. However, with the widespread adoption of credit cards, the fraudulent activities were dramatically increased and getting more challenging for financial institutions to detect. To maintain trustworthiness and preventing losses of a financial institution, detecting, and even preventing credit card fraud has become a crucial topic in the industry in recent years. 

Credit cards system provides seamless transactions in both online and offline, regardless of location in the worldwide. This allows consumers to make their purchases and manage their finances more conveniently. It changes the way people purchase a product or service, manage their bills, travel without worrying about foreign currency etc. The conveniences, ease of use and allowing consumers to leverage has contributed to their widespread adoption globally. 

This project focuses on leveraging knowledge and technology of data science, machine learning and predictive analytics to develop robust models that will be capable of identifying and flagging fraudulent activities in credit card transactions. The targeted end-users of the credit card fraud prediction model predominantly consist of professionals within financial institutions, including Risk Management Team, Security Teams and Regulatory Compliance Officers.

## Problem Statement
In the contemporary landscape of digital transactions, the surge in credit card fraud poses a significant challenge that traditional detection methods struggle to keep up with. Developing a credit card fraud prediction model becomes imperative as fraudsters continually refine their strategies. The problem at hand is complex, considering the dynamic and subtle nature of fraudulent activities and the necessity for a model that adapts in real-time to emerging patterns. Dealing with imbalanced datasets, ensuring interpretability, and addressing privacy concerns add layers of complexity to the challenge. This project endeavours to create credit card fraud prediction model that not only identifies and prevents fraudulent transactions but also scales effectively, adapts to evolving fraud tactics, and complies with regulatory standards. By doing so, it seeks to bolster the resilience of financial institutions against the persistent and ever-evolving threat of credit card fraud.
